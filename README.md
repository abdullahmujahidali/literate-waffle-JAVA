Create a class called Fractions. A fraction contains a numerator and a demonjoatec Both the numerator and the denominator are integers. 1) Prompt the user for the first fraction. Prompt for a numerator and then a denominator. 2) Once the numerator and denominator have been entered. Print out the fraction in it's simplest form. Here are some examples: a. Numerator is 2, demonimator is 3. You print 2/3 b. Numerator is 2, denominator is 4. You print 1/2 c. Numerator is 3, denominator is -4. You print-3/4 d. Numerator is - 3, denominator is 4. You print 3/4 e. Numerator is 2, denominator is 2. You print 1 f. Numerator iso, denominator is 1. You print Loop until valid numerators and denominators are entered. O is not a valid demoninator. 3) Prompt the user for the second fraction. Prompt for a numerator and then a denominator. Print out as you have done for the first fraction. 4) Print of the following results in the following format: 2/3 +3/4 = 17/12 = 1 5/12 2/3-3/4 2/3 3/4 = 1/2 2/3 +3/ 4 8 /9 2/3 Please enter an Integer Please enter the first denominator Please enter annon-zero Integer -17 Please enter the second numerator> Please entre second denominator 13/7 -1/2- 3/7--113/14
